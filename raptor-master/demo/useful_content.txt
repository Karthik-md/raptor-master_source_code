With the research-oriented master’s program in Theater – Research – Transfer, FAU offers a qualification that is both academically sound and professionally oriented for those interested in theater studies content and issues with a focus on artistic practices and communication processes in cultural institutions. The students will work as a future generation of theoretically versed practitioners in responsible, formative positions in the field of artistic practice, in the areas of dramaturgy, theater pedagogy, curating, public relations and cultural management, etc.. At the same time, the program opens up the possibility of further academic qualification, for example in the context of a doctorate in theater studies.
The triad of theater – research – transfer takes into account recent developments in the arts, sciences and communication. In all of these areas, fundamental social, political, technical, and aesthetic transformations are occurring that challenge established practices as well as the role and self-image of the actors and institutions involved. We meet this challenge by making the content and forms of teaching more flexible and dynamic. The goal of the degree program is not the application of already established knowledge to new areas, but the training of the ability to react flexibly to the cultural challenges of the present and their ever-changing demands.
The starting point for this is theater, understood under the sign of a broad concept of theatricality, which does not limit questions about forms of staging, physical techniques and perceptual processes to the arts, but explicitly includes political and social communication. This results in a variety of references to other humanities subjects (such as philosophy, sociology, literature and art studies), to the positions of performance, body and gender theory, as well as to theories of globalization and interculturality. Special attention is given to the relationship between theatrical practices and digitalization.
The field of research is also currently affected by profound upheavals that affect the self-image of the university as well as its relationship to artistic-creative practice. We understand the latter in the sign of “artistic research” not as an object of disciplinary knowledge, but as an independent method of knowledge generation. This is accompanied by an expansion of concepts and methods, which can only be grasped in an explorative and experimental way and is to be developed in an exchange between scientists, practitioners and students.
In the area of transfer, we dedicate ourselves both to already established dramaturgical and pedagogical professional fields (cultural education, playbill and program design, public relations) and to experimental forms that go hand in hand with the revaluation and dissolution of boundaries in curating. Practice-related questions and contents are developed in close exchange with cultural institutions; the students are involved in the work fields and processes of a concrete professional practice within the framework of internships.
The first semester is dedicated to the central fields of theater studies (theory, historiography, performance analysis) and fundamental questions of mediation practice. In the second semester, these topics are deepened and tested in the context of an artistic project in exchange with guest artists. The third semester is characterized by two obligatory external internships, which are flanked by accompanying courses. In the fourth semester, the degree program concludes with a master’s thesis and an oral examination.

Study contents:
The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Archaeological Sciences is a first professional degree earned after three years of study (six semesters). However, many professional fields require a Master’s degree.
The combined course of study from its three sub-fields is in itself special, because it covers an unusually broad field of archaeology (if one adds the subjects that the University of Bamberg offers in the teaching association, then archaeology can even be studied up to modern times). The studies in Erlangen are particularly practically oriented. With the two large publicly accessible teaching collections, one learns how to work in a museum, but also conducts research on and with original objects.
The great methodological and content-related breadth of archaeological sciences in Erlangen offers graduates of the program good career prospects in the field of monument preservation, in museums and in research itself. On the job market, a doctorate is currently often required as a qualification.

DNA discovery and molecular exploration have provided insights into biochemistry, cell biology and environmental protection. Biology degrees qualify students for research, development and application in life sciences such as medicine, agriculture and forensics. If you are interested in modern biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics and can work independently, studying biology at FAU is ideal.
Biology is the natural science that studies all the laws of life. While a few decades ago the focus was still on observing nature, the discovery of DNA and the breakdown of important metabolic processes gradually led to research into the molecular connections of life. In recent years, this has led to an enormous increase in knowledge in all areas of biology, from biochemistry to cell biology, basic research for medicine, agriculture, nutrition and environmental protection. Those who study biology today learn the techniques and interrelationships of a fascinating science whose new findings continue to influence our view of ourselves and of nature.
With a degree in biology, you’ll qualify for research, development and application in the life sciences – from developing new medicines to breeding more environmentally resistant plant varieties to forensic analysis. So if you enjoy the issues of modern biology, are not put off by minor subjects such as chemistry, physics and mathematics, and have the ability to work independently, then studying biology at FAU is just right for you.
Biologie #2
Biologie #1
Biologie #3
In our biology program, you will study the laws of life. You study the molecular basis of life processes as well as the function, development, coexistence and evolution of living organisms. In addition, you deal with the practical application of biological findings, e.g. for the development of innovative drugs or for food production.
Although our bachelor’s degree program is a complete biology program, you should note that the focus in Erlangen is on cell and molecular biology. Almost all advanced courses are located in this department. Specialization in organismic botany/zoology, ecology, marine biology or human biology is not possible in Erlangen.
The numerous fields of biology, as well as the adjacency to other subjects such as chemistry, medicine or pharmacy, enable biology graduates to pursue a very broad range of careers. Many biologists work in research and development at universities and other research institutions, as well as in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. However, they are also in demand in production, quality control, marketing or sales in such companies. Other possible fields of work are:

In the first two semesters, modules 1 through 4 teach the essentials of the subject. Here you will learn what writing-based media are, how the system of written media communication is structured, and what resources are necessary to make it work. You will learn about theoretical approaches that help you understand what, for example, writing, media, and communication are, and you will be introduced to methods that serve as tools for answering questions relevant to book studies.
This first study phase is concluded with the so-called Fundamentals and Orientation Examination (GOP) at the end of the second semester. For this, you must successfully complete modules 1 to 3 by passing the respective examinations.
In the two following semesters, the core modules 6, 7 and 8 will help you to deepen your knowledge of the subject matter. These introduce you to the essential aspects of the communication process of writing-based media in the form of lectures, which are then further developed in seminars. You will learn about the processes of communication and their influencing factors and control mechanisms, learn about the cultural technique of reading, and become familiar with the actors who ensure that writing-based media are produced and disseminated.
Your final two semesters are about being able to show what you have learned. In Module 9, you will independently develop questions with relevance to everyday life and strategies for answering them. This can then also lead to your Bachelor’s thesis. Module 5 and internships that you complete during your studies will provide you with practical experience. You can do these both in Germany and abroad.
The Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in Book Studies is a first degree qualifying for a profession, which is acquired after three years of study (six semesters).
Following modules are provided:
Most importantly, you must be interested in the subject and its contents, be able to develop enthusiasm even for the unfamiliar or difficult, and show full commitment.
We want you to be open to media that we take for granted and therefore often encounter with preconceived notions. However, we want to deal critically with books, newspapers and magazines and question how they have developed into what they are, what opportunities but also risks are associated with the various formats, distribution channels and cultural techniques and what status they had, have and possibly will have.
You should have the desire and also the will to work independently: We are not teachers pushing you from school assignment to school assignment; rather, you are spurring yourself on as you study what you want of your own accord.
We also expect you to enjoy reading academic texts: This includes engaging with them and feeling elated at how they produce insights that help you progress – not just in the current seminar or semester, but beyond your studies.
In media companies, especially in publishing houses, all departments such as editing, marketing and sales, press or licenses come into question, but staff positions such as assistant to the management or in corporate development are also attractive. The IT department is becoming increasingly important. At the distribution level, i.e. in the book, press or general media trade, the focus today is on the logistics of physical and digital media, information management and customer orientation. Other specialized alternatives are communications agencies, communications departments of large companies or cultural institutions. Additional specialization comes from your second subject in the bachelor’s program and from internships you have done during your studies.

As a prospective economist, you will learn to understand and analyze economic relationships in order to develop successful strategies for business management, marketing, financing or even trade and investment policy.
In the bachelor’s degree program Business and Economics, you will acquire basic knowledge of economics, including its methods. The program prepares you for professional activities in industrial and service companies, administration, associations and political parties. By combining basic knowledge of business administration and economics with a second subject, the requirements for a wide range of professional activities are met.
In business administration, questions of marketing, production and procurement, organizational management, strategic corporate management and corporate accounting are studied in depth. In economics, the focus is on economic policy contexts, especially monetary and fiscal policy, social and labor market and financial policy in Germany and the European Union.
In concrete terms, you will deal with the fundamentals of economics, in which – partly mathematically formalized – models are used to analyze, for example, the behavior of individuals and households in economic decisions. On the other hand, central macroeconomic relationships such as the emergence of unemployment or inflation are examined or explanations are presented as to what determines long-term economic growth. These topics are explored in depth in advanced lectures and in the economics proseminars and applied to current issues, such as the causes and effects of the global financial crisis as well as the debt crisis in the euro zone or the significance of demographic change.
You will also learn important basics in business administration, including management, logistics, marketing and financing. In addition, you will receive training in the basics of business accounting and an overview of important legal principles for economists.

The program can be studied as an extension subject in addition to two main subjects in the teacher training degree. The standard duration of study in the program is nine semesters. The program is divided into three fields of study: Chinese language, discipline-specific knowledge, and Chinese didactics.
There are no special requirements to enroll in the program. All Chinese language courses are designed for participants without previous knowledge of Chinese. You should, however, be interested in foreign cultures and enjoy learning languages.
There are many good reasons to study Chinese Studies in Erlangen!
Excellent Chinese language classes: The language classes take place in small groups under the guidance of pedagogically trained native speakers. This guarantees success in learning Chinese characters, pronunciation, and grammar.
Modern facilities: The Institute for Chinese Studies is located in a modern building with an adjoining garden. The classrooms are equipped with the latest technology in the form of whiteboards. The Chinese Studies library with workspaces for students is located directly on site. The library is the largest seminar library at the Friedrich-Alexander-University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and one of the largest in Germany.
Good support: Our lecturers are committed to help students in their studies – they always have an open ear for student concerns and inquiries. If you have problems, you can also contact our active student council initiative (FSI) at any time.
Wide range of courses: A wide range of research fields and class topics, in cooperation with other disciplines at FAU as well as national and international cooperation partners, enable a differentiated and reflected picture of Chinese-speaking countries in the past and today.
Extracurricular activities: In addition to the compulsory classes, many voluntary activities take place at the institute. Among them are summer festivals and barbecues, a Chinese theater group, and regular excursions in Europe, China, and Taiwan.
Study abroad: As part of your studies, a stay abroad in China or Taiwan is possible. Our lecturers will help you plan your stay abroad and apply for scholarships.
The degree qualifies for work as a Chinese teacher at high schools in Bavaria. Chinese is a fixed subject at some high schools and an elective subject at a large number of high schools in Bavaria. As a result, the demand for professional Chinese language teachers is steadily increasing. Nevertheless, there is still a great lack of qualified Chinese teachers at secondary schools in Bavaria.

Details and notes: The application deadline for international applicants is July 15th for the winter semester and January 15th for the summer semester.Technical developments are becoming increasingly complex and are based to a large extent on mathematical principles. Engineers are therefore dependent on powerful hardware and software and mastery of computer science methods as key skills. This is the only way they can successfully develop new products, compare technical solutions or predict the effects of design decisions. Computational Engineering was developed on the basis of these insights and combines computer science, mathematics and engineering as interdisciplinary, equal teaching content in one course of study. The field is a globally recognized discipline that deals with solving physical problems in science and technology using mathematical models, computer and software systems.
The Master’s degree program is designed to allow students to pursue studies both in computer science and in an engineering field of their choice. For this reason, applicants are required to have knowledge in both of these areas. Ideally, students should have either a Bachelorʼs degree in Computational Engineering or an engineering degree with a strong computer science component. A good mathematical background is essential. The program requires a minimum of 2 years of engineering mathematics at the university level. Additionally, knowledge in numerical mathematics is strongly recommended. The Master’s degree program takes a minimum of four semesters. The last semester focuses on preparation of the Masterʼs thesis. The thesis is intended to introduce students to research work at the university.
As the degree program has an international perspective, both German and English modules are offered. Examinations may be taken in either English or German and the Master’s thesis may be written in English. This means that international students may complete the degree program entirely in English.
Candidates must choose a technical application field (TAF) when they apply. We strongly advise that you contact the program coordinator or the TAF coordinator for more information about the technical application fields. A description of all TAFs available in the current academic year is available here.
The Master’s degree program in Computational Engineering, along with two partner programs at Technische Universität München, forms the basis for the Bavarian Graduate School of Computational Engineering (BGCE) Elite degree program. Students may apply for this after completing the first semester of the regular Master’s degree program. The highly project-specific and research-oriented modules offered in the Elite program add even more possibilities to those already available in the regular program. In addition to collaboration between partner programs, shared soft skills courses are also held regularly.
The components of the Master’s degree program in Computational Engineering are one seminar, modules in the three main areas – mathematics, computer science and the technical application field (TAF) – and the Master’s thesis.
There is a standard study plan for each TAF, although all modules in the Master’s degree program are elective. Students can choose their modules from the module catalogues of various Master’s degree programs in computer science, engineering, applied mathematics and physics. In order to participate in the Elite degree program students must complete 30 additional ECTS credits.
Elective modules in mathematics [30 ECTS]
Mathematics modules can be chosen from the applied mathematics module catalogs or from the Faculty of Engineering. The modules must be mathematics based.
Elective modules in computer science [30 ECTS]
Students can choose modules offered by the Department of Computer Science for the Master’s degree program in Computer Science.
Elective modules in the technical application field, TAF [30 ECTS]
In this area students can choose modules from all Master’s degree programs at the Faculty of Engineering, with the exception of modules offered by the Department of Computer Science.
Seminar [5 ECTS]
The seminar is part of one of the elective subjects listed above. Students can therefore choose a seminar from a Master’s degree program at the Department of Computer Science, applied mathematics or another module from the Faculty of Engineering that is related to the TAF.
Master’s thesis [30 ECTS]
Students can register for the Master’s thesis at the Examinations Office as soon as they have successfully completed 70 ECTS credits. The thesis requires approximately 810 hours of work and must be completed within six months after registration. The topic of the thesis must be related to the subjects that the student has studied over the course of the Master’s degree program. All students are usually assigned one supervisor for their thesis. The Master’s thesis may involve regular meetings with the supervisor and/or members of a larger research group. It may be written in English. An oral presentation of the results lasting 30 minutes with a subsequent discussion form part of the assessment.
Elite program [30 ECTS]
‘Do more – get more!’ is the motto of the BGCE Elite degree program. This means that students must complete an extra 30 ECTS credits within the standard duration of studies. These credits are divided into three groups, with 10 ECTS credits each for different subject-related modules, soft skills and an additional project. The subject-related modules include specific summer schools, compact courses and the regular workshop where participants take part in discussions with students from the partner programs (research day). Soft skills modules include management skills, teaching and academic writing. For the project, students generally develop software to solve a specific practical problem as a team.

German language skills for international applicants: No DSH, English (level B2, CEFR)Are you interested in the function and social as well as historical significance of sacred works of art? How religious practices were changed and influenced by the interpretation of Christian theologians? Or what the relics of late antiquity or early Christianity said about the politics of the time? Then you have come to the right place! Discover the world of Christian-influenced European culture and Oriental Christianity.
Society, art, literature and politics were already closely intertwined in the Middle Ages – with Christianity as the foundation. In the study program Cultural History of Christianity, sources and phenomena of the Christian-influenced European culture and oriental Christianity are developed, interpreted and historically classified. The study imparts basic knowledge of the history of Christianity of over 2000 years.
For example, we ask ourselves questions about the dimensions of meaning of religious practices, for example in liturgy. The sacral function, but also the political explosive power, of Christian works of art is examined. What biblical content is used in these objects? What do the artistic and literary relics of this time say about society and politics? By which important theologians, mystics or other chroniclers were biblical interpretations influenced and how did these changes affect religious practices? How is the development of Christianity to be understood against the background of the disintegrating late Roman Empire? Understanding communication, interaction, and media representations of Christianity also requires a good scholarly knowledge of the origin, content, and structure of the Bible.
In short, the course provides an overview of the most important cultural achievements of Christianity in a historical perspective. The content offered, which consists of six theological sub-subjects, makes clear the important role played by theology: Early Church History, Modern Church History, Christian Archaeology and Art History, History and Theology of the Christian East, Old Testament and New Testament.

Study contents:
The enumeration of career opportunities can only provide a limited insight. Moreover, since Cultural History of Christianity is a very young course of study, no concrete professional profile has yet emerged. By providing training in a variety of skill areas and by fostering communication and reflective skills, graduates of Cultural History of Christianity can gain a foothold in many fields outside the discipline. As a general rule, students should seek information as early as possible from the academic advisor and contact persons from their own program of study about the respective prerequisites (BA, MA, PhD) for a particular career field.

Attention: Enrolment in the Master’s degree course will be suspended for the coming winter semester 2024/25!
The Erlangen Master’s degree program in Digital Humanities is an interdisciplinary, partially English-language degree program that is characterized both by a specific content profile and by an individually selectable focus. Through the close interlocking of fields of investigation in the humanities and computer-based analysis methods, it offers both a practice-oriented and a research-oriented education.
The profile of the curriculum, which has a strong technical-informatics orientation, includes practical methods of computer science, such as pattern recognition, graphical data processing, computer vision, and databases for the study of cultural heritage.
At the core of the degree program are four subject areas:
These topics are complemented by a profound insight into media ethics and IT law. An individual focus is provided by a large elective area, which is drawn from ongoing research projects. In a project module, students are prepared for independent research and for various professional fields.
The degree program is designed for four semesters. In the first semester, theoretical and methodological foundations are developed, on which subject areas from the humanities and computer science build. In the further course of studies, students can choose between free supplementary studies, internships, stays abroad and team projects.
In a one-year project, students work in groups and/or with external partners on current research questions. This serves to deepen and apply the acquired knowledge.
Within the free supplementary studies, students expand their scientific horizons according to their individual focus. They choose from modules in related disciplines such as computational linguistics, digital art history, museum studies, theater and media studies, cultural geography, archaeology, or other humanities.
In the fourth semester, students write a master’s thesis in their chosen field of study and discuss it in a colloquium.
Graduates of the master’s degree program in Digital Humanities have a wide range of career prospects. The degree program qualifies students for entry into research in the young but internationally rapidly growing field of digital humanities. At the same time, graduates will find challenging career opportunities in future-oriented fields of work at the interface of computer science and the humanities, e.g. in the cultural sector or education.
For the Master’s degree program M.A. Digital Humanities, a completed first university degree (e.g. Bachelor) with a subject-specific or related degree is required.
A subject-specific degree is defined as a degree in a bachelor’s program in Digital Humanities and Social Sciences or Digital Humanities or Digital Humanities. If a subject-specific degree is available, applicants with an overall grade of up to 2.50 will be admitted directly to the Master’s degree program; applicants with an overall grade of 2.51 to 3.75 will only be admitted after a successful selection interview.
Other Bachelor’s degrees are recognized as related to the subject, provided they include a minimum of 25 ECTS credits in computer science and 25 ECTS credits in humanities and/or social sciences. In this case, a successful selection interview and an overall grade of at least 3.75 are required.

This course aims for students to acquire basic knowledge of Japan’s digital transformation, qualitative and quantitative methods, and skills to conduct data analysis independently. We train students through various exercises so that they can confidently use the professional literature and digital primary and secondary sources.
The goal of this course is for students to conduct original research and make progress in the acquisition of scientific facts. To this end, we provide careful supervision by helping students appropriately narrow down their research objects and select appropriate theories and methods. In supervising the thesis, we make every effort to encourage students to contribute something new to the state of research.﻿
Social science research on Japan has become increasingly important in German-speaking countries in recent years. Moreover, digital transformation is currently one of the most important research objects worldwide. Against this background, this course of study was established with the expectation that students will acquire a high level of competence in critically analyzing the phenomenon of digital transformation and efficiently dealing with digital sources such as social media posts and electronic newspaper articles.
Students begin in the 2nd semester by acquiring basic knowledge about politics and media in Japan. In the 3rd semester, they deal intensively with qualitative and quantitative methods in order to be able to conduct independent data analyses later on. In the process, students are provided with various digital materials (ranging from social media posts to YouTube videos) by the instructors for practice in applying the methods. From the 4th semester, students participate in seminars on current issues related to Japan’s digitalization (telecommunication policy, labor, etc.). Careful supervision of final theses is provided through an upper-level seminar on scientific presentation.
Very intensive supervision, a good atmosphere for discussions and presentations, and the teaching of the current state of research are central features of this course.
Possible career paths after graduation include academia, journalism, diplomacy (e.g. at the German Foreign Office, the Japanese Embassy, or the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs), and the private sector (e.g. German companies in Japan, Japanese companies in Germany and Japan).
Selected applicants can participate in the exchange program with partner universities in Japan. We recommend that students apply for a DAAD-PROMOS scholarship if they wish to participate in the exchange program at FAU.

Technomathematik is a course in German.
In addition to the general qualification for university entrance (Abitur), there are other access options for studying at FAU.The degree program covers all relevant areas of English and American Studies. It also allows students to specialize in one of five key areas: American Studies, British Studies, Cultural Studies, Linguistics or Literary Studies. It is also possible to work towards a General Studies degree.
Scholars in American Studies, British Studies or English linguistics deal scientifically with the language, literature and culture of English-speaking societies. The four sub-disciplines that make up the program are linguistics, literary studies, cultural studies and language practice. While British Studies focuses on the linguistic and cultural region of Great Britain, American Studies deals mainly with the United States and Canada. Other English-speaking regions that may play an important role are the Caribbean region, India, Australia and South Africa.
Questions asked in the course include: Why did English become a world language? What influence has the history of colonization had on British and American self-understanding? Why is Shakespeare a British icon, and why are his plays still popular? How are different cultural groups changing American and British society today? How can a literary text have very different meanings, and how can I figure them out? What role do popular novels and television series play in the formation of a national identity?

FAU - Moving Knowledge
Students complete a series of modules. Each module consists of individual courses. The choice of modules is governed by the relevant Study and Examination Regulations (FPO). In addition, ‘key qualifications’ must be acquired and foreign language skills must be demonstrated.
For our BA English and American Studies, the degree program looks as follows:
The structure of the program (additional ‘key qualifications’ must also be acquired)
Basic modules in the 1st and 2nd semester (All basic modules must be completed)
Specialization starting in the 3rd semester (selection of one of the following fields of study)
Bachelor thesis
American Studies, British Studies, Cultural Studies, General Studies, Linguistics, Literary Studies
As in the humanities in general, there are a variety of ways to start a career, because there is no clear-cut job description for graduates of English and American Studies. You may find them for example…
Since English language graduates can usually move around abroad with confidence and communicate well, they are also in demand at internationally active companies and at NGOs (non-governmental organizations). In some industries, for example in publishing, a doctorate can be useful, but it is not a guarantee for an academic career. Prospective graduates who do not want to go into the teaching profession should make intensive efforts to obtain additional qualifications during their studies. This is usually done through internships, which can help to get a more precise idea of the working world and one’s own career goals.
Those who expect mainly English lessons will be disappointed. Good English skills are already required at the beginning of the study.

Students can look forward to various subject areas for which many, different methods are used: Cartography, observations, interviews, GIS. In addition to cultural geography, students have a wide range of electives at their disposal, such as: Economics, Sociology, Political Science, or a Linguistics (students must choose one of these electives).
Ecological crises and environmental problems, globalization and regionalization, migration, intercultural communication, and urban and regional development are just a few examples of socially relevant topics that are among the central contents of current geographic education at universities.
Students deal with the description, explanation and interpretation of social and natural phenomena and their interactions in a spatial perspective. They face the challenge of understanding and explaining social and ecological change as well as the complex interactions of humans with their environment.
In their studies, they address causes and effects at global and local scales. They are enabled to participate actively and competently in solving spatially related social and ecological problems.
Cultural Geography also deals with societies and the spatiality of human activity.

In research, geoscientists work with highly specialised and high-resolution chemical and physical laboratory and field analysis. Therefore, the geosciences are a very diverse branch of science in which there are constantly new research findings and methodological developments.
Basically, geoscientists deal with the interrelationships and interactions of the Earth system and the structure, evolutionary history and current and future state of our planet Earth and its habitats. All geoscientific processes of the Earth system in the lithosphere, hydrosphere and biosphere are examined. This includes all geological, chemical, physical and biological procedures and processes that have taken place and are currently taking place from the formation of the Earth to its present appearance.Current issues and important scientific areas are research into raw material deposits (metals, oil, natural gas), geothermal energy, natural disasters (volcanoes, earthquakes), climate impact research, the development of new materials (CO2-neutral cements, high-performance ceramics, bone substitutes) and engineering geological and hydrogeological issues (e.g. subsoil investigations, slope analyses, geophysics). e.g. subsoil investigations, landslides, designation of water protection areas, investigations of the water cycle), as well as the investigation of past and present ecosystems (climate archives, biodiversity, reaction of organisms and ecosystems to environmental influences).
In our Bachelor’s degree program in geosciences, you will deal with relationships and interactions of the Earth system and all the associated basics. In addition to theory, this also includes modern training in laboratory and working methods and practical training in the field. The first four semesters you study according to a predefined course plan, after which you can choose your focus depending on your interests. Particular focus is placed on climate research, sustainable resource research, alternative and renewable energies, development and optimisation of materials, and geodynamics and evolutionary research.

The Bachelor’s degree program in Earth Sciences is divided into two sections. The first area is the four-semester basic studies. It teaches the basics of geology, mineralogy and palaeontology, as well as the natural sciences of biology, chemistry, mathematics and physics. This is followed by two semesters of the specialisation phase. In this phase, three of five specialisations are selected. The Bachelor’s degree is completed in the sixth semester with the Bachelor’s thesis. In a period of eight weeks, you work on your own, small, scientific project and write a written paper about it. In addition, you present your research results at the end of the program in a colloquium in the form of a seminar presentation.
Out of five specialization fields, three can be selected in the Bachelor’s degree. We offer the following specializations:
Enthusiasm for the Earth system, climate research, sustainability research, and ideally rocks.
In addition, there should be a general interest in the natural sciences of chemistry, physics, mathematics and biology.
Together with our students, we explore the Earth system to find solutions for the challenges of the future.
We research:
We offer:
The numerous fields of geosciences also encompass a large number of different occupational areas. Geoscientists work in Germany and abroad, for example in engineering offices, universities, the chemical industry, the State Office for the Environment, laboratories, museums and research centres. The career prospects are very good due to the broad scientific education.
During your studies in geosciences, you will definitely have the opportunity to spend one or more semesters abroad. For this purpose, we have concluded partnership agreements with universities in Europe and the rest of the world. You can find an overview of the most common opportunities for a stay abroad, e.g. Erasmus or our direct exchange with universities in the USA, on the pages of the Faculty of Natural Sciences. Here you will also find information about internships abroad especially for natural scientists.
Already in the first semester you need a Geology Hammer and a magnifying glass for the exercises (purchase costs: approx. 60-70 Euros).(Travel) costs are incurred when participating in excursions. However, since FAU provides some financial contributions for the excursions, the personal costs are not too high.

In addition to the general qualification for university entrance (Abitur), there are other access options for studying at FAU.Are you interested in the German language, literature and culture and would like to deepen your knowledge? Then a Bachelor’s degree in German Studies is just right for you. In the German Studies program, you will intensively study the German language, its history of development, its literary and cultural contexts, and its role in society.
Do you like reading and are you interested in the German language? You don’t want to go to a mass university and study anonymously? If you can identify with these statements, you already meet important requirements for studying German Studies at FAU. If you don’t shy away from more abstract thinking and are interested in theoretical and methodological issues, all the better. You will learn and practice writing and working with scientific texts during your German studies.
In the field of Modern German Literature you will deal with German-language works from the Luther period to the immediate present, whereby non-fictional texts such as travel reports, reportages or diaries are also considered in addition to poetry in verse and prose. The indexing is carried out under historical and systematic perspectives, and the cultural contexts play just as important a role as questions of classification, aspects of media dissemination, or references between German literature and other national literatures.
In the history of older German literature (medieval studies), one learns to deal with texts from the period of the Middle Ages (ca. 800 to 1500). In contrast to popular contexts, such as fantasy literature or medieval festivals, the focus is on a reflected scientific and historical examination of the literature of this epoch, which is (only) quite foreign to us at first glance. Heroic epics such as the Nibelungenlied are used, for example, to discuss the historical development of gender roles, to examine the form of presentation of the narrative text, or to pose questions about the practice of transmission. Knowledge of Middle High German is acquired during the course of study.
Linguistics deals with the structure and use of language. Language is the object of study as something material, audible or written, which can be analyzed in terms of its components, units and functions. Language is also the means of communication used by human beings. Under this aspect, the specifics of oral versus written communication, linguistic varieties such as dialects and colloquial languages, as well as the historical variability of language become the subject of study.

Gerontology deals with this phenomenon and researches the effects of aging on people and society. The Gerontology master’s degree program therefore offers a wide range of topics, from the biology of aging to social and societal aspects.
The Master’s degree program in Gerontology (M.Sc.) is aimed at interested persons with a university or college degree related to gerontology who wish to acquire in-depth knowledge of issues related to aging research. Prospective students should attach importance to scientific interdisciplinary work and to a practical qualification oriented towards the needs of older people.
The Master’s program in Gerontology (M.Sc.) imparts competencies and subject-specific key qualifications for leading activities in areas of gerontological practice such as administration, counseling and diagnostics, evaluation and quality assurance, intervention and therapy, as well as teaching and research. The program covers the current state of knowledge and clinical practice in gerontology and its related disciplines such as geriatrics, nutrition science, psychology, social sciences, and exercise science. The Master’s program in Gerontology (M.Sc.) qualifies graduates to develop, implement and apply new concepts for their own professional practice in an enormously growing and forward-looking professional field. A subsequent doctorate is possible within the framework of the doctoral program in Gerontology at the Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nuremberg.

It is a consecutive, research-oriented Master’s degree program with a broad but exclusive focus on healthcare.
As a constantly growing industry, the German healthcare sector is confronted with numerous changes and challenges, which arise, among other things, from demographic change, medical-technical innovations, and constantly changing legal and structural framework conditions. The resulting scarcity problems require the most effective and efficient allocation of resources possible. In order to cope with the changes and to further develop the health care system despite the challenges, qualified specialists are needed who, in addition to industry-specific technical and methodological knowledge, also have a sound knowledge of economics in order to shape and advance the German health care system in the future through innovative interdisciplinary approaches. The Master in Health Care Management and Health Economics prepares its students for this career.
Students take a range of compulsory interdisciplinary courses that provide them with comprehensive insights into the healthcare system and can choose specializations that enable them to become experts in management, economics or politics. The degree program’s focus on the German healthcare system and the extensive practical knowledge that students require means that graduates have excellent career prospects.

There is also the opportunity to complete a semester abroad by taking equivalent courses at a foreign university. Furthermore, students have the possibility of taking two further health-related Master’s modules at the faculty, the university or also at other universities in Germany and abroad within the framework of free elective modules. Seminars with reference to recent topics in cooperation with partners of the university promote important competencies for entering the profession. The degree program is completed with the Master’s phase, which consists of a Master’s thesis and a Master’s seminar.
This degree program is aimed at all graduates with Bachelor’s degrees in business studies who are interested in healthcare. Previous knowledge of business and economics is required but knowledge of heath management/health economics is not necessary.
The program is taught in German. Therefore, a good knowledge of German is an essential prerequisite to successfully completing the degree program.
For further information, please visit the German WiSo website.
The Master’s degree program prepares students for careers in industry as well as research.

German language skills for international applicants: DSH 2 or equivalentYou are interested in the Spanish cultural area, its literature, history and culture and would like to further (scientifically) deepen this knowledge as well as your language skills? Then Hispanic Studies is the right place for you!
Spanish is not just something you can study for a teaching degree. But what exactly do you do when you choose the Bachelor’s degree program in Hispanic Studies? Of course, language learning and theoretical reflection on the language and culture are the main focus. In addition to practical language courses (e.g., in grammar, text production, or pronunciation), seminars on the processes of development and transformation of language, literature, and culture are also an important part of the bachelor’s program. In addition to the language, of which you should already have a basic knowledge, you will therefore also deal academically with linguistics, cultural studies, literary studies and regional studies.
In a proseminar on Spanish literary studies, for example, you will become acquainted with Latin American novels that are classified as magical realism and examine the extent to which this is a cultural movement that differs from contemporary developments in Europe. In a linguistics lecture, for example, you will deal with Spanish in the Caribbean, the contact there with other languages, or with varieties of Spanish on the Iberian Peninsula.
You can best practice and deepen your language skills abroad. FAU maintains active exchange programs with Spanish universities (including Alicante, Barcelona, Cádiz, Córdoba, Madrid, Málaga).

FAU - Moving Knowledge
In the modularized two-subject Bachelor’s degree program, Hispanic Studies can be chosen either as a first subject or as a second subject. The first subject differs from the second subject by the writing of a Bachelor’s thesis. In addition, eight modules must be completed in the first subject and seven modules in the second subject (= teaching and learning units that are self-contained in terms of time and content with examinations during the course of study).
In the first, one-year study phase, students acquire a broad basis in the areas of language practice, linguistics and literary studies by attending introductory courses (basic modules).
In the second study phase, subject and methodological competencies are expanded, specialized and contextualized (advanced modules).
In the third study phase, further specialization takes place in a selected scientific area. Students are enabled to work independently and scientifically (advanced modules).
Due to the internationalization of many companies today, it is of great value to have a very good command of Romance languages in addition to English. On the one hand, this makes it possible to work abroad, but it also plays an important role when applying for jobs in Germany. Romance language graduates can therefore find employment in many professional fields due to their language skills. However, they are particularly in demand in the following areas, in which the knowledge of cultural history acquired during their studies also comes into play:

Anatolian, Celtic and Tocharian? Can you actually still learn these languages today? Of course, even if the Indo-Germanic and Indo-Iranian Studies program is probably not as familiar to one as, say, German Studies or History. The aim of the course is to describe these and other Indo-European and Indo-Iranian languages in detail, to explain their similarities and differences, and to reconstruct the prehistoric Indo-European basic language and discover new things in the process.
Therefore, the initial focus of the bachelor’s program is on learning the languages. Here there are introductory courses for e.g. Sanskrit, Runic Norse or Hittite. But what good are languages if we don’t use them? They are put into practice in seminars, for example, on the ancient Persian inscriptions of the Great Kings Darius or Xerxes, the epics of Homer or the Gothic Wulfila Bible. In addition to the linguistic seminars, there are also events on mythology and culture in the regions of origin.

In your studies you will not only acquire language and cultural competences in a specific field. It generally prepares you for dealing with different languages that are distantly related to each other and enables you to analyze, reconstruct and compare the origin and development of languages and cultures.
By dealing with different languages, their texts, their history as well as their writings, you learn the ability to deal with unknown contents and structures in a reflective way and acquire a high intellectual flexibility, e.g. in transfer thinking.

General language skills: C1 (Englisch)You are interested in the Italian cultural area, its literature, history and culture and would like to further (scientifically) deepen this knowledge as well as your language skills? Then this is the right place for you!
Italian is not just something you can study for a teaching degree. But what exactly do you do if you choose the bachelor’s degree program in Italian Romance Studies? Here, in addition to learning the language, the focus is precisely on theoretical reflection on Italian language, literature and culture. Following on from the practical language courses (e.g. oral communication, text production or regional studies), lectures and seminars on linguistic, literary and cultural development and transformation processes in particular are an important part of the Bachelor’s program. In addition to the language, whose elementary basic knowledge you should already have, and aspects of regional studies, you will also deal with linguistics, literature and cultural studies. You can also set individual focal points.
In a proseminar on Italian literature, for example, examples of the novella genre from the Middle Ages to the present can be examined from the perspective of the representation of reality. Language problems, gender construction, and identity aspects can be examined. In a linguistics lecture you will deal, for example, with the grammatical structures of Italian, with dialects and minority languages in Italy, or with the history of Italian as a language.
You can best practice and deepen your language skills abroad. FAU maintains active exchange programs with Italian universities (including Bari, Bergamo, Milano, Parma, Pisa, Rome, Siena, Turin, Udine). If you have chosen the subject combination Italian Romance Studies/Germanic Studies, there is also the possibility of an international double degree in cooperation with the Università per Stranieri di Siena (Mediazione Linguistica Culturale – Traduzione in ambito turistico imprenditoria.

In the modularized two-subject bachelor’s degree program, Italian Romance Studies can be selected either as a first subject or as a second subject. The first subject differs from the second subject by the writing of a Bachelor’s thesis. In addition, eight modules must be completed in the first subject and seven modules in the second subject (= teaching and learning units that are self-contained in terms of time and content with examinations accompanying the course of study). If Italian Romance Studies is chosen as the first subject and German Studies as the second subject, it is possible to obtain a binational double degree in cooperation with the Università per Stranieri di Siena (Mediazione Linguistica Culturale – Traduzione in ambito turistico imprenditoriale).
In the first, one-year study phase, students acquire a broad base in the areas of language practice, linguistics and literature by attending introductory courses (basic modules).
In the second study phase, subject and methodological competencies are expanded, specialized and contextualized (advanced modules).
In the third study phase, further specialization takes place in a selected scientific area. Students are enabled to work independently and scientifically (advanced modules).
Due to the international orientation of many companies today, it is of great value to have a very good command of Romance languages in addition to English. On the one hand, this makes it possible to work abroad, but it also plays an important role when applying for jobs in Germany. Because of their language skills, Romance language graduates can find employment in many professional fields. However, they are particularly in demand in the following areas, in which the linguistic, literary and cultural knowledge acquired during their studies also comes into play:

The integration of intelligent and automated systems enables complex and efficient production processes. The bachelor’s degree program in mechatronics provides in-depth knowledge of mechanics, electrical engineering and computer science, thus laying the foundation for a successful career in industry or research. After graduation, graduates have access to fields of activity in various sectors, such as the automotive industry, mechanical and plant engineering, and robotics and sensor technology.
Mechatronics is still a young, technical field with a very high degree of innovation and great growth potential. Today, many mechatronic products are already an integral part of our everyday lives, such as ABS, ESP, an electric window regulator or transmission controls in cars, modern robots in industry, a simple DVD player or even the controls of large commercial aircraft.
Mechatronic systems automatically acquire information and signals, independently extract new data from them and convert them into forces and movements. Mechatronics therefore combines content from the classic engineering disciplines of mechanical engineering/mechanics, electrical engineering/electronics and computer science and links them to form a new, future-proof subject area in which interdisciplinary and systems engineering thinking plays a major role.
The bachelor’s degree program in mechatronics at FAU imparts comprehensive basic knowledge from the fields of mechanical engineering, electronics/electrical engineering and computer science. This enables graduates to later independently familiarize themselves with the wide range of tasks and to master the constantly changing problems encountered in professional practice. The program consists of compulsory, elective and optional modules and includes ten weeks of practical work experience, as well as a bachelor’s thesis lasting approximately ten weeks, which must be completed during the course of study.
The standard period of study is six semesters. The number of points required for successful completion – the organization of studies and examinations is based on the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System – is 180 ECTS points in the Bachelor’s program.

In addition to the general qualification for university entrance (Abitur), there are other access options for studying at FAU.The media world is a constantly growing and dynamic field that shapes and influences our everyday lives. The Master’s degree program in Media Studies offers the opportunity to view and analyze this complex field from different perspectives. Through an interdisciplinary approach, students not only learn current media science theories, but also acquire practical skills in dealing with digital media and new technologies. Graduates are thus ideally equipped to work successfully in a wide range of professional fields such as journalism, marketing or public relations.
Whether photography, film, television, series, video, whether analog or digital images – as a decidedly research-oriented course of study, the Master’s degree in Media Studies aims to impart methodological, theoretical and analytical knowledge about (audio-)visual media. Technical image media and their historical predecessors are examined in their cultural, social and aesthetic dimensions, with a particular focus on the interconnections between individual (audio-)visual media and their practices. From handcrafted image artifacts to the image forms of the Internet, the course deals with a broad range of phenomena of visual cultures in both synchronic and diachronic perspectives.
The program can be completed on a full-time or part-time basis. It consists of ten modules that build on each other. The basic modules create a common starting point for all students in the areas of theory, history and analysis. This careful exploration of the state of research is then combined with theory-oriented in-depth seminars and courses on practice and presentation.
Modules 5 to 8 serve to deepen and specialize by systematically reflecting on historical and present-oriented issues as well as the digitalization of society. Module 9 complements the research-oriented approaches with practice-related components and contemporary forms of media-supported knowledge presentation, thus strengthening the theory-practice links.
The profile of Erlangen Media Studies is characterized by a clear focus on visual media in both analog and digital image cultures. The focus is on a media-comparative approach, which takes into account the current tendencies to dissolve boundaries and the interconnections in and between individual media.
This comparative approach to image media provides students with a multifaceted and historically grounded perspective on both individual media and media systems. In addition to this academic profiling, Master’s students benefit from the technical infrastructure of the Institute for Theater and Media Studies, which includes a media and sound studio, numerous editing suites, and a Games Lab.
The Master’s degree program imparts competencies for the independent scientific handling of media products within and outside of university research practice. It prepares students for professions in the fields of media, culture and the arts in which reflective and responsible activities are required. The acquired reflective, research and conceptual skills qualify students for subsequent doctoral studies as well as for professions in cultural institutions such as film festivals, art-house cinemas, television and radio stations, museums or publishing houses.

Degree Program Fees: 11.000,00 €Experience the path of science in the Pharmacy degree program: 8 semesters of hands-on lab experiments. Develop, manufacture, and assure the quality of medicines. Let your scientific ambition blossom and become part of a life-changing industry.
Pharmacy is a natural science teaching and research subject and deals with the development, production and quality assurance of medicines, the preparation and storage of medicines as well as their effect and safe use. The first forms of pharmacy already existed at the dawn of mankind. This makes it one of the oldest sciences of all.
The study of pharmacy mainly prepares you for the profession of pharmacist. However, it is a broad scientific study, in which many aspects of chemistry and biology (with regard to drugs and humans) are also taught. To a lesser extent, physics and mathematics also play a role. If you like puffing and fizzing, you’re in good hands here. Even though theory takes up a large part of the course, the study program is very practical and many exciting hours in the laboratory await you.
After graduation, you will be able to produce, analyze and evaluate all kinds of drugs. You know how and why drugs reach their target in the human body and know the modes of action of tablets, ointments and others. A number of doors are open to you and you are spoilt for choice as to which direction you would like to take.

The scientific study of pharmacy prepares students for the work of pharmacists in industry, science, pharmacy and testing authorities.
Pharmacists, who as drug experts are faced with multifaceted and demanding tasks, are responsible for the development, production, testing and dispensing of drugs.
The university course ends after 8 semesters with the 2nd state examination and, together with the subsequent practical year, is considered a necessary prerequisite for licensure as a pharmacist.
For the profession as a pharmacist in science and industry, a (approx. 3-year) doctorate to the degree of Dr. rer. nat. is generally required. Doctoral theses can already be taken up during the practical year.
The study of pharmacy is divided into different areas (basic studies, main studies and practical year).
The basic studies provide a broad scientific education in general, inorganic, organic, physical, pharmaceutical and analytical chemistry (especially inorganic, organic and instrumental analysis), in biochemistry, in biology (especially systematic and pharmaceutical botany), mathematics and physics (especially experimental physics).
The main studies extends and deepens this knowledge in the field of development, extraction and testing of drugs and preparations as well as their biopharmaceutical behavior. In addition, interrelationships between the chemical structure and action of the drugs and mechanisms of physiological-chemical processes, molecular processes and interactions between the components of the various drug preparations are made clear. Students can also choose from various elective courses in the main study period:
The classic field of activity of pharmacists (approx. 85%) is in public pharmacies or hospital pharmacies. However, due to their strongly interdisciplinary education, they are also qualified for other fields of activity, e.g.

In addition to the general qualification for university entrance (Abitur), there are other access options for studying at FAU.In this varied Bachelor’s degree program, you will research how people think, feel and act. You will learn how to apply psychological theories and methods to solve problems and understand behavior. These include topics such as personality development, cognition, decision-making and social interaction.
In psychology, one observes, describes and explains the experience and behavior of people, their development over the course of life and all of the internal and external causes and conditions that are relevant to this. The Bachelor’s degree program is interdisciplinary – it contains parts from the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities.
Psychology is an empirical science, i.e. information, data and experiences are systematically collected through scientific methods such as experiments, surveys or observations. Based on this data about experience and behavior, theories about the psychological structure and functioning are developed and tested. In order to be able to adequately analyze the collected data, it is essential to acquire a knowledge of statistics. But don’t worry: experience shows that even students who didn’t get along very well with mathematics at school can achieve good results in statistics exams thanks to good supervision during their studies. However, a willingness to learn and perform are essential prerequisites for this.

All relevant internal and external causes and conditions are observed and described. The study of psychology is interdisciplinary and combines aspects from the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities. The master’s program in psychology offers in-depth training in scientific and methodological knowledge as well as practical professional and research qualifications. It enables you to work independently as a psychologist in research and application.
Psychology is an empirical science in which one observes and describes the experience and behavior of human beings, their development in the course of life and all the internal and external causes and conditions that are decisive for this.
The study is interdisciplinary – so it contains parts from the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities. Psychology is an empirical science, i.e. information, data and experiences are systematically collected through scientific methods such as experiments, measurements, surveys or observations. Using these data about experience and behavior, theories about mental structure and functioning are developed and tested.
The master’s degree program in psychology provides in-depth scientific and methodological knowledge as well as in-depth practical professional and research qualifications. It qualifies you for independent work as a psychologist in research and application.
On the one hand, the master’s degree program offers the opportunity to gain broad qualifications in different areas of psychology, but on the other hand, it allows you to develop a personal profile by focusing on one of the following three areas:
The supplementary area (formerly: minor) offers another possibility for individual emphasis. Here, students can choose between a number of subjects from other scientific disciplines, e.g. biology, gerontology, human biology, computer science, linguistic computer science, economics/economics, philosophy, physiology, psychosomatics. Alternatively, modules from the elective program of the M.Sc. Psychology can be brought in.
Study contents:
At the Institute of Psychology it is possible to study in the Master of Science without an emphasis or to specialize (determined by the examination registration under the elective area of the chosen emphasis or without an emphasis in the registration system).
The DGPs has awarded us the seal of quality for the B.Sc. Psychology degree program. The seal documents that our degree program meets the demanding criteria for a good education in psychology. The seal is also intended to facilitate the work of accreditation commissions, which have to decide on questions of quality and comparability of degree programs. The Erlangen Institute thus joins the ranks of equally distinguished institutes at other German universities (overview and further details on the seal).
The degree program prepares students for managerial and independent work in selected professional fields (health and social services, education, science, administration, industry, law). In addition, the choice of specialization allows you to design your studies in such a way that the prerequisites for further postgraduate education in the field of psychology, especially for psychotherapy training, can be attained. In addition, graduates with a Master’s degree will also have the opportunity to pursue a doctorate.

Explore how legal rules operate in government, society, business and the private sector. Learn how laws are created, who implements them, and how they are applied in court cases. Delve into the exciting field of constitutional law, which includes fundamental rights and rules governing government bodies. Explore administrative law and learn how government agencies act and how to defend against decisions.
Coexistence in the state, society, the economy and in the private sphere is shaped by legal rules in the form of laws and regulations. By studying public law, you will learn how these rules are made, who implements them, and how they are applied in court proceedings.
Public law includes first of all constitutional law: these are the rules that apply to the state organs (Bundestag, Federal Government, etc.) as well as the fundamental rights (e.g. freedom of religion, freedom of opinion and freedom of assembly). In addition, public law includes administrative law, which deals on the one hand with the actions of public authorities, and on the other hand with how one can defend oneself against decisions of the administration. Finally, we include the law of the European Union (EU) and the law that applies to all states (international law) in public law.
Public law and political action are closely related: One realizes this when thinking about elections to the Bundestag, the importance of EU rules for economic policy decisions, or the review of laws by the Federal Constitutional Court. That is why you can combine the first subject Political Science with the second subject Public Law in Erlangen.
In the first semester, the introductory module, the basic module and the module on state organization law take place. In the following semesters, the modules Basic Rights, General Administrative Law, Administrative Law I and European and International Law I are offered. In the sixth semester, you can take either European and International Law II or Administrative Law II and thus pursue your special interests. In the sixth semester you will also write your Bachelor’s thesis in your first subject (Political Science).
Internships, language courses, insight into neighboring disciplines and qualifications in working techniques (library, presentations, rhetoric) must be proven within the key qualifications (amounting to 30 ECTS points).

In addition to the general qualification for university entrance (Abitur), there are other access options for studying at FAU.Modern class composition is heterogeneous today, regardless of school type. Social changes and migration have led to many students not speaking German as their first language. The Chair of Didactics of German as a Second Language (DiDaZ) at FAU is intensively dedicated to language acquisition, language teaching and language-aware subject teaching. In the study of German as a Second Language (DaZ), you as a prospective teacher will be qualified to support students linguistically appropriately and to design lessons in a targeted manner.
Further information about the DaZ-studies can be found on the website of the Chair of Didactics of German as a Second Language, where also the dates of information events of the chair for first-year students are published regularly at the beginning of the semester. For student advice on German as a Second Language, you can contact Marisa Somper (Teaching Subject Elementary and Middle School) and Kirstin Ulrich (Extension Subject and Professional Language German).

The DaZ course comprises 11 ECTS for students of elementary school, and 20 ECTS for students of middle school. Middle school students complete the DaZ study program with the state examination, for students with a teaching degree in elementary school there is no state examination.
Can be chosen by students or graduates of all teaching positions and can be completed with a state examination. The extension studies can be started in any semester. At least three semesters should be planned for the study. Students of elementary and middle school as well as special education study DaZ as an undergraduate extension (scope 45 ECTS). The subsequent extension (10 ECTS) can be studied by students of Realschule and Gymnasium as well as by teachers of all school types with a second state examination. It is nevertheless recommended for this target group to complete the undergraduate program, since all courses prepare students for the state examination and later professional practice.

It is also possible to obtain a certificate for teaching in BAMF courses and abroad.
