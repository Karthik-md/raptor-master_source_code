Course / lectures: Praktikum : Basic of Lasers - Lab sessions (1 SWS ) 1 ECTS Vorlesung mit Übung: Basics of Laser (3 SWS ) 4 ECTS
Lecturers: Prof. Dr. Nicolas Joly  
Module coordinator: Prof. Dr. Nicolas Joly
Contents: Laser technology developed enormously since its first demonstration in 1960. Although at that time laser was described as "a solution in search of a problem it is nowadays used everywhere, from high-precision spectroscopy to bar-scanner in supermarkets, from eye-surgery to metal welding for car industry. The lecture focuses on the basics of laser and serves as a first glance in the fascinating world of coherent light sources. It reviews four major aspects of lasers: (i) the description of the active material, which provides the gain for the system (ii) the laser cavity, which defines the spatial structure of the laser beam (iii) the propagation of laser beam using the ABCD matrices formalism and (iv) the different dynamical regimes of laser, in particular the way to generate pulses. Besides the lecture/exercises the students are invited to test the concepts seen during the lecture on two laser systems: a solid-state Nd:YAG laser and a Er-doped fibre laser. During lab exercises the students will work on concepts seen during the lecture on two laser systems: a solid-state Nd:YAG laser and a Er-doped fibre laser.
Learning objectives and skills: Students will be able to: •Describe the active material using the rate equations •Check the stability of a laser cavity and extract the beam parameters from the physical parameters of the cavity (length, radius of curvature of the mirrors etc.) •Use ABCD matrix to define the spatial properties of a laser beam and shape the beam (focusing, coupling etc.) •Align a laser cavity and observe the different spatial modes that can be generated •Understand the different dynamical behaviours of a laser (mode-locked laser, Q-switch laser, continuous).

Module coordinator: Prof. Dr. Nicolas Joly
Contents: This module naturally follows the "Basics of Lasers module and aims at deepen the knowledge on a few specific aspects of lasers. In particular we will study the Z-cavity of one of the most popular laser system: the Titanium: sapphire laser. The purpose here is to show why simpler cavity is not possible. It requires understanding properly the concept of stability of laser cavity and introduces the problem of astigmatism. In a second stage we see how dispersion effects can hamper the properties of a mode-locked laser system and see how to circumvent this. We then study the different method used to characterize ultrashort laser pulse. This starts from basics concepts of autocorrelation but review more advanced techniques allowing to retrieve fully the amplitude and phase of a laser pulse. Towards the end of the lecture several topics are possible and it will be chosen together with the students. This can be for instance (i) the polarization and the Jones formalism (ii) the Maxwell-Bloch equations (iii) the origin of spontaneous emission. Finally in order to broaden the contents of the lecture the students are asked to prepare one half-an- hour presentation of the topics of their choice. The topics are discussed during the first two sessions of the lecture and must focus on a physical aspect of laser.
Learning objectives and skills: Students •Understand the problem of dispersion in a laser cavity and establish a strategy to balance this problem in order to achieve transform-limited ultrashort pulses •Estimate the duration of a laser pulse and adapt the technique to the level of precision required •Understand the design of laser cavities

Lecturers: -  
Module coordinator: PD Dr. Andreas Erdmann
Contents: Semiconductor lithography covers the process of pattern transfer from a mask/layout to a photosensitive layer on the surface of a wafer. It is one of the most critical steps in the fabrication of microelectronic circuits. The majority of semi-conductor chips are fabricated by optical projection lithogra-phy. Other lithographic techniques are used to fabricate litho- graphic masks or new optical and mechanical devices on the micro- or nanometer scale. Innovations such as the introduc-tion of optical proximity correction OPC), phase shift masks (PSM), special illumination techniques, chemical amplified resist (CAR) materials, immersion techniques have pushed the smallest feature sizes, which are produced by optical pro-jection techniques, from several wavelengths in the early 80ties to less than a quarter of a wavelength nowadays. This course reviews different types of optical lithographies and compares them to other methods. The advantages, disad-vantages, and limitations of lithographic methods are dis-cussed from different perspectives. Important components of lithographic systems, such as masks, projection systems, and photoresist will be described in detail. Physical and chemical effects such as the light diffraction from small features on ad-vanced photomasks, image formation in high numerical aper- ture systems, and coupled kinetic/diffusion processes in mod-ern chemical amplified resists will be analysed. The course includes an in- depth introduction to lithography simulation which is used to devise and optimize modern lithographic processes.
Learning objectives and skills: The students •understand the principles of optical projection lithography •understand how optical and material-driven resolution enhancements work •get an introduction to Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography •get an overview on alternative lithographic techniques •get an introduction to computational lithography •discuss the role of nanoscale light scattering effects

Contents: English Version: This module focuses on recent developments in image processing driven by medical applications. All algorithms are motivated by practical problems. The mathematical tools required to solve the considered image processing tasks will be introduced. The module starts with an overview on preprocessing algorithms such as scatter correction for x-ray images, edge detection, super-resolution and edge-preserving noise reduction. The second chapter describes automatic image analysis using feature descriptors, key point detection, and segmentation using bottom-up algorithms such as the random walker or top-down approaches such as active shape models. Furthermore, the module covers geometric calibration algorithms for single view calibration, epipolar geometry, and factorization. The last part of the module covers non-rigid registration based on variational methods and motion-compensated image reconstruction.

Contents: Optical data transmission systems are the enabler for our modern communication networks. Since the first systems have been installed, the transmission capacity as well as the transmission distance has been increased dramatically. The migration from point-to-point transmission systems to complex optical networks is still in progress. The fast evolution of optical transmission technology is stimulated by innovations in the field of the system key components. The lectures concentrate on the physical effects and properties of key components like semiconductor lasers, optical modulators, optical fibers, optical amplifiers and detector diodes. Especially also the nonlinear effects of the transmission fiber are discussed. The main focus is on the effects and characteristics which are important to achieve a certain system performance. The influence of component parameters on system performance is presented in examples related to installed systems and systems that are actually in development. The exercises partly use a numerical simulation tool to analyze the component influence on system performance.
Learning objectives and skills: Students •Understand structure and operation of components of optical communication systems •Rate the optical properties of components and evaluate the influence of operational parameters on system performance •Are able to analyze the influence of linear and nonlinear fiber effects on optical signals and system performance •Can make use of system simulation tools to engineer optical links

Contents: Global communication between billions of subscribers utilizing a multitude of devices is accomplished over a trans-continental fiber-optic transport network. End users worldwide access this network over copper cable (xDSL, HFC), by wireless technologies like WLAN, GSM, UMTS, LTE and also via GPON, EPON and WDM-PON (PON: Passive Optical Network). After a short distance ("the last mile") data streams from many users are aggregated (e.g. by IP routers) into higher data rate transport streams, which are then carried over cost-efficient and highly reliable optical connections. Rapid increase of data traffic has quickly evolved from Gigabit Ethernet (1GbE) to 10GbE and 100GbE data rates. To operate optical networks on a global scale, standards like OTN (Optical Transport Network) have been developed to provide high capacity links by use of many wavelengths together with operations and maintenance (OAM) functions. Automated protection and restauration schemes provide a high level of availabilty and can guarantee carrier- grade Quality of Service (QoS). Future data rate increase will be driven by video streaming as well as the introduction of 5G wireless technology and the Internet of Things (IoT). The course shall provide a fundamental understanding of modern fiber optic networks from fixed and mobile access through metropolitan area to core networks. 1)Introduction – Evolution of optical networks 2)Network layers - Internet Protocol – TCP/IP 3)Label switching – MPLS – MPLS-TP 4)Quality of Service - traffic classification – resource allocation 5)Ethernet - switching and physical transport 6)Optical Transport Network - OTN 7)Optical fiber properties – optical amplification 8)Optical transmitter – laser – modulator 9)Optical receiver – photo detection – Clock&Data recovery – Bit Error Ratio calculation 10)Modulation formats – transmission - margin allocation 11)Coherent detection – optical signal processing 12)Optical networks – optical switching 13)Network control & automation

Contents: This module naturally follows the "Basics of Lasers module and aims at deepen the knowledge on a few specific aspects of lasers. In particular we will study the Z-cavity of one of the most popular laser system: the Titanium: sapphire laser. The purpose here is to show why simpler cavity is not possible. It requires understanding properly the concept of stability of laser cavity and introduces the problem of astigmatism. In a second stage we see how dispersion effects can hamper the properties of a mode-locked laser system and see how to circumvent this. We then study the different method used to characterize ultrashort laser pulse. This starts from basics concepts of autocorrelation but review more advanced techniques allowing to retrieve fully the amplitude and phase of a laser pulse. Towards the end of the lecture several topics are possible and it will be chosen together with the students. This can be for instance (i) the polarization and the Jones formalism (ii) the Maxwell-Bloch equations (iii) the origin of spontaneous emission. Finally in order to broaden the contents of the lecture the students are asked to prepare one half-an- hour presentation of the topics of their choice. The topics are discussed during the first two sessions of the lecture and must focus on a physical aspect of laser.
Learning objectives and skills: Students •Understand the problem of dispersion in a laser cavity and establish a strategy to balance this problem in order to achieve transform-limited ultrashort pulses •Estimate the duration of a laser pulse and adapt the technique to the level of precision required •Understand the design of laser cavities

Module coordinator: PD Dr. Andreas Erdmann
Contents: Semiconductor lithography covers the process of pattern transfer from a mask/layout to a photosensitive layer on the surface of a wafer. It is one of the most critical steps in the fabrication of microelectronic circuits. The majority of semi-conductor chips are fabricated by optical projection lithogra-phy. Other lithographic techniques are used to fabricate litho- graphic masks or new optical and mechanical devices on the micro- or nanometer scale. Innovations such as the introduc-tion of optical proximity correction OPC), phase shift masks (PSM), special illumination techniques, chemical amplified resist (CAR) materials, immersion techniques have pushed the smallest feature sizes, which are produced by optical pro-jection techniques, from several wavelengths in the early 80ties to less than a quarter of a wavelength nowadays. This course reviews different types of optical lithographies and compares them to other methods. The advantages, disad-vantages, and limitations of lithographic methods are dis-cussed from different perspectives. Important components of lithographic systems, such as masks, projection systems, and photoresist will be described in detail. Physical and chemical effects such as the light diffraction from small features on ad-vanced photomasks, image formation in high numerical aper- ture systems, and coupled kinetic/diffusion processes in mod-ern chemical amplified resists will be analysed. The course includes an in- depth introduction to lithography simulation which is used to devise and optimize modern lithographic processes.
Learning objectives and skills: The students •understand the principles of optical projection lithography •understand how optical and material-driven resolution enhancements work •get an introduction to Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography •get an overview on alternative lithographic techniques •get an introduction to computational lithography •discuss the role of nanoscale light scattering effects

Contents: Deep Learning-based algorithms showed great performance in many fields of image processing and pattern recognition and compete with technologies such as compressive sensing and iterative optimization. The basis for the success of these algorithms is the availability of large amounts of data (big data) for training and of high computing power (typically GPUs). In this seminar, we try to explore advanced deep learning methods. In particular, we will aim to develop a deeper understanding of certain topics, for example, graph neural networks, unsupervised learning, differentiable learning, invertible learning, neural ordinary differential equations, transfer learning, multi-task learning, uncertainty DL, etc.

Contents: This module naturally follows the "Basics of Lasers module and aims at deepen the knowledge on a few specific aspects of lasers. In particular we will study the Z-cavity of one of the most popular laser system: the Titanium: sapphire laser. The purpose here is to show why simpler cavity is not possible. It requires understanding properly the concept of stability of laser cavity and introduces the problem of astigmatism. In a second stage we see how dispersion effects can hamper the properties of a mode-locked laser system and see how to circumvent this. We then study the different method used to characterize ultrashort laser pulse. This starts from basics concepts of autocorrelation but review more advanced techniques allowing to retrieve fully the amplitude and phase of a laser pulse. Towards the end of the lecture several topics are possible and it will be chosen together with the students. This can be for instance (i) the polarization and the Jones formalism (ii) the Maxwell-Bloch equations (iii) the origin of spontaneous emission. Finally in order to broaden the contents of the lecture the students are asked to prepare one half-an- hour presentation of the topics of their choice. The topics are discussed during the first two sessions of the lecture and must focus on a physical aspect of laser.
Learning objectives and skills: Students •Understand the problem of dispersion in a laser cavity and establish a strategy to balance this problem in order to achieve transform-limited ultrashort pulses •Estimate the duration of a laser pulse and adapt the technique to the level of precision required •Understand the design of laser cavities

Contents: Neuroscience has played a key role in the history of artificial intelligence (AI), and has been an inspiration for building human-like AI, i.e. to design AI systems that emulate human intelligence. Neuroscience provides a vast number of methods to decipher the representational and computational principles of biological neural networks, which can in turn be used to understand artificial neural networks and help to solve the so called black box problem. This endeavour is called neuroscience 2.0 or machine behaviour. In addition, transferring design and processing principles from biology to computer science promises novel solutions for contemporary challenges in the field of machine learning. This research direction is called neuroscience- inspired artificial intelligence. The course will cover the most important works which provide the cornerstone knowledge to understand the biological foundations of cognition and AI, and applications in the areas of AI-based modelling of brain function, neuroscience-inspired AI and reverse-engineering of artificial neural networks.
Learning objectives and skills: The students •Explain the principles of neural information processing in the brain •compare and analyze methods from neuroscience to study neural networks •explain the neuroscientific underpinnings of artificial intelligence •explain principles and concepts of cognitive science •explain principles and concepts of neuroscience •compare and analyze machine learning methods to analyze neural data •explain approaches from deep learning to model brain function •discuss the commonalities of neuroscience and artificial intelligence •implement the presented methods in Python •explain concepts from cognitive neuroscience for the design of artificial intelligence systems

Contents: Companies in all kinds of industries are producing and collecting rapidly more and more data from various sources. This is enabled by technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-physical systems (CPS) and cloud computing. Hence, there is an increasing demand in industry and research for students and graduates with machine learning and data analytics skills in the Industry 4.0 context. The goal of this seminar is to give students insights about state-of- the-art machine learning and data analytics methods for industrial and business applications. In this seminar, the Industry 4.0 term will not only be limited to manufacturing processes, but comprise all business functions. Students will mainly work independently on either an implementation- centric or a research-centric topic. The implementation-centric topics will focus primarily on the implementation of algorithms and analytical components (using provided or open source datasets), while the research-centric topics will focus on researching and structuring literature of a specific field of interest. Several topics will be provided, but students are also encouraged to propose their own topics when applying for the seminar. In the regular meetings, students will learn about fundamentals and trends in Industry 4.0 from a machine learning perspective, common machine learning techniques and their implementation, project management of data analytics projects in businesses, as well as best practices for presentations and scientific work. The programme will be complemented by talks from invited experts in the domain. Furthermore, students will present results from literature research and data analytics projects.
Learning objectives and skills: •Students will develop an understanding of the current hot field of machine learning and data analytics in businesses •Students will learn to research and present a topic within the context of machine learning and data analytics in businesses independently •Students will learn to identify opportunities, challenges and limitations of corresponding ML approaches in businesses
