Learning objectives and skills: This module aims to provide an introduction into the state of the art of plastic recycling. Current regulations in plastic waste management throughout the world, as well as the demands towards more sustainable plastics and the transition to a circular economy pose many challenges in collection and sorting of plastics wastes and their conversion to (processable) recyclates. This course will provide the concepts of collection and sorting of plastic wastes as well as the basics of chemical, mechanical recycling and thermal conversion of plastic waste streams. The students will learn to understand ‘plastic wastes’ as a sustainable resource for the plastics and chemical industries. Moreover, they will be able to assess the most useful recycling approach for a certain waste stream depending on composition and degree of contamination. In the context of mechanical recycling of thermoplasts, the students will be able to assess viable strategies of additive enhancement of recylates to cope with the challenges in processing.

Course / lectures: Vorlesung mit Übung: MA Quantitative Methods in Energy Market Modelling (3.0 SWS )5 ECTS
Lecturers: Prof. Dr. Karl Gregor Zöttl  
Module coordinator: Prof. Dr. Karl Gregor Zöttl
Contents: It is the purpose of the course to understand and quantitatively analyse the economic interaction of the players and institutions in liberalized energy markets. Liberalized electricity markets can be segmented in a regulated part (the networks) and the non-regulated parts (generation and retail) where private companies interact in a market environment. The interaction of the different agents is analysed with computational equilibrium frameworks based the concepts applied in industrial organization. Next to the fundamental understanding of the relevant market interaction, the models allow for a quantitative analysis of proposals for the design of energy markets. The participants thus develop the tools for an autonomous assessment of currently discussed policies in liberalized electricity markets (e.g. changed support schemes for renewables, changed network tariff systems, impact of capacity markets). The course aims at students in the field of economics /business as well as students in the fields of engineering and mathematics. An integral part of the course id formed by homework assignments conducted in groups. The ability to cooperate also beyond the classical limits of each discipline is an important qualification for the students careers, which should be stimulated in the context of this course.
Learning objectives and skills: The students: •develop a clear picture of the relevant market participants in liberalized electricity markets and understand their incentives and objectives •learn fundamental concepts and models which allow to analyze the interaction at those markets •get to know important publically available data sources which allow for a quantitative analysis of the market situations considered •know the current challenges when designing those markets and can quantitatively analyze the solutions proposed in the current policy debate.
Prerequisites: The students should be familiar with the mathematical methods acquired during their Bachelor degree. Institutional knowledge of electricity markets is not required.

Contents: • Introduction to polymer recycling and the circular economy of plastics (definitions, basic concepts, plastic wastes as a valuable and sustainable resource, challenges) •Collection and sorting of plastic wastes (collection schemes, (fundamentals of) separation and classification processes, sorting and recycling plants) •Chemical recycling of plastics (solvolysis, thermolysis, pyrolysis) •Mechanical recycling of thermoplasts (extrusion, injection moulding, examples (primary recycling of polyethyleneterephthalate, secondary recycling of polyolefins etc.)) •Thermoplast recyclates –additive enhancement and challenges in processing (compatibilizers, antioxidants etc.) •‘Thermal recycling’ of waste streams •Recycling of fiber-enhanced composites (cf. rotor blades •Trends towards more sustainable plastics – recent innovations in polymer recycling, recycling of biopolymers?
Learning objectives and skills: This module aims to provide an introduction into the state of the art of plastic recycling. Current regulations in plastic waste management throughout the world, as well as the demands towards more sustainable plastics and the transition to a circular economy pose many challenges in collection and sorting of plastics wastes and their conversion to (processable) recyclates. This course will provide the concepts of collection and sorting of plastic wastes as well as the basics of chemical, mechanical recycling and thermal conversion of plastic waste streams. The students will learn to understand ‘plastic wastes’ as a sustainable resource for the plastics and chemical industries. Moreover, they will be able to assess the most useful recycling approach for a certain waste stream depending on composition and degree of contamination. In the context of mechanical recycling of thermoplasts, the students will be able to assess viable strategies of additive enhancement of recylates to cope with the challenges in processing.
